⏰ THE ULTIMATE POMODORO 🎯🌗
The productivity timer that slaps harder than your deadlines.

💥 What the heck is this?
This is a badass PyQt5-powered Pomodoro timer that helps you focus, rest, repeat—and look good while doing it. We're talkin’ smooth animations, theme toggles, encouraging quotes, and even a chunky toggle switch. It’s not just functional, it’s fabulous.

🧠 Features
🧠 Focus Mode: 5 minutes of laser-focused productivity. Zoom zoom!

🧘‍♀️ Short Breaks: Chill for 5 minutes like the productivity guru you are.

🍹 Long Breaks: 15 minutes to walk, stretch, or contemplate existence.

💡 Theme Toggle: Dark mode for your inner goth. Light mode for your sunlit vibes.

✨ Animated Transitions: Bouncy mode labels and fade-in quotes? Yes please.

📢 Motivational Quotes: Because sometimes you just need a lil' pick-me-up.

🔊 Sound Alert: alarm.wav slaps when time’s up (if you have it, that is).

🧰 Requirements
Python 3.x

PyQt5

(Optional) alarm.wav for that spicy end-of-timer bing

pip install PyQt5


🚀 Running the App
Clone the repo (or copy the code like a boss):
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ultimate-pomodoro.git
cd ultimate-pomodoro

🔁 Timer Logic (TL;DR)
Focus ➡ Short Break ➡ Focus ➡ Short Break ➡ Focus ➡ Short Break ➡ Focus ➡ LONG Break

Then the cycle restarts like your caffeine addiction ☕️

🎨 Theming
Switch between light and dark mode with a juicy toggle button. It even has animated circles and everything. We fancy, huh?

🎯 Quotes
Get hit with a random motivational quote after every session. They’re cute, quirky, and 100% millennial-approved.

“One step closer to greatness 👟”
“Breaks make brains sharper ✨”
“Focus fuels success 🧠”
etc.

🧪 Dev Notes
This baby is built with 💖 in PyQt5.

Wanna customize the timer durations? Just tweak self.durations in Pomodoro.__init__().

Want to change the vibe? Add more quotes or styles. Go nuts.

🔔 Sound Alert
Make sure you have alarm.wav in the same directory as the script. If you don't? It won't crash—because we thought ahead. But it's way more fun with the sound on.

💀 Known Issues
Sound doesn't play? Check that your OS supports QSound and that alarm.wav exists.
